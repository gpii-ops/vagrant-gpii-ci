Vagrant-GPII-CI
===============

Scope
-----

Vagrant-GPII-CI is a vagrant plugin that is used to simplify the definition of a Vagrantfile. It uses virtual machine and scripts definitions to spin up complete enviroments where you can run your tests or applications.

Installation
------------

The installation is as simple as running this command in your shell:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-gpii-ci
```

The recommended dependencies are:

 * Virtualbox 5.2 or higher
 * Vagrant 2.0.0 or higher

Working with VMs
----------------

No Vagrantfile is required if a [.vagrant.yml](vagrant.yml.template) file is found in the root of the repository.

The name of the file can be override using the environment variable `VAGRANT_CI_FILE`.

Commands:

 * `vagrant up [vm]` to spin up the vms defined in the `env` variable.
 * `vagrant destroy [vm]` to stop and destroy the vm.
 * `vagrant reload [vm]` to stop and destroy the vm.
 * `vagrant halt [vm]` to shutdown the vm without destroy it.
 * `vagrant ci test [--stage STAGE] [vm]` to run all the stages defined in the `stages` variable, at the selected vm. If the `--stage` option is used, Vagrant will only run the stage spcified.

Note:

 * The `vm` parameter is not necessary in environments with only one VM defined.


Virtual Machines definition
---------------------------

The `env` variable must have a child variable called `vms` that lists the names of the virtual machines defined. Each name of a VM must have some additional options.

The options available for a vm definition are:

 * `3d` - Enable 3D support. _False_ by default.
 * `autostart - Starts the vm when the command `up` is executed. _True_ by default.
 * `box` - Defines the base box that the vm will use. `Required`
 * `clone` - Use the [Vagrant clone feature](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/virtualbox/configuration.html#linked-clones) to make the creation of the vm faster. _False_ by default.
 * `cpu` - Defines the number of the virtual CPUs. `Required`
 * `memory` - Defines the amount of RAM memory assigned to the VM. `Required`
 * `sound` - Enables a dummy sound card in the VM. Disabled by default
 * `gui` - Enable the GUI of the VM. _True_ by default.

### Samples


```
env:
  vms:
    windows10:
      cpu: 2
      memory: 2048
      clone: true
      autostart: true
      box: inclusivedesign/windows10-eval
```

In the following example we use the [merge](http://yaml.org/type/merge.html) feature of YAML to simplify the virtual machines definitions.

```
env:
  default: &default
    cpu: 2                   # number of cpus
    memory: 2048             # amount of RAM memory
    clone: true              # use the linked_clone Vagrant feature
    autostart: false         # only start a VM when it's specfied in the command line
  vms:
    windows10:               # name of the VM
      <<: *default           # referece of the common part
      3d: true               # enable 3D acceleration
      sound: true            # add a sound card to the VM
      box: inclusivedesign/windows10-eval
    windows81:               # name of the VM
      <<: *default           # referece of the common part
      box: inclusivedesign/windows81-eval-x64
    windows7:                # name of the VM
      <<: *default           # referece of the common part
      box: inclusivedesign/windows7-eval-x64
```

Networking
----------

All the VMs have access to Internet using the gateway of the host through a NAT interface by default.

In the case of multi VM environments, a additional NIC card is create in each VM with a private IP address of a private network where all the VMs are connected. The IP range of this network is 192.168.50.0/24. The IP addresses assigned to each VM start by 10 and is incremented by 1 in additional VMs.

Mapped ports
---------------

The port mapping is configured in the VMs definition. The `mapped_ports` variable is a list of ports that will be mapped from the VM to the host.

```
mapped_ports:
  - 8080
  - 8181
```

Tags
----

The tags can be used to run specific stages in some VMs. A stage with a set of tags will be only executed in the VMs that have those tags listed. If a stage doesn't have tags defined it will be executed in all VMs.

  default: &default
